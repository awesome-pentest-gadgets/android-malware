This malware has a secret backdoor which will allow attacker to remotely 
download a malicious APK called "polacin.io" to the device. 

After the victim is tricked into allowing the code to be installed, the 
Android device sends a wide array of information about the hardware to 
command and control servers, plus the user's email address and location.

Hackers make money from the malicious app through ad click fraud and by
pushing mobile scareware.
