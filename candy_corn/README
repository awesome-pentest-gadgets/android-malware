The malware affects versions of Android older than v.5 (Lollipop) and requires 
root permission to hijack the shut down process.

After pressing the power button, the phone displays an authentic shutdown 
animation, and the phone appears off. Although the screen is black, it is still on.

While the phone is in this state, the malware can make outgoing calls, take 
pictures and perform many other tasks without notifying you.
