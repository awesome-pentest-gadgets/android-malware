The main functionality of the Trojan is to send out information about the device 
to a C&C (command and control) server and to then wait for the server to respond 
with new commands to carry out.

The general information that is sent to the C&C server:
IMEI
ISO country code
SIM operator name
Android build version
Phone number
SIM serial number
Is this app the default SMS app?
Is this app the device admin?
The current version number of the Trojan
Generated unique user ID for this phone

and Immediately after launching the app for the first time, the icon is hidden 
from the launcher to make the Trojan a bit more elusive. The app then proceeds 
to do a simple check for an emulator. If the check confirms that the app is 
running in an emulator, no malicious activity is started.
